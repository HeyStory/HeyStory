# HeyStory

A digital platform for preserving and sharing your family's most meaningful memories.

## Overview

HeyStory is a secure, AI-powered space where families can easily capture, preserve, and share their legacies. Whether it's childhood tales from grandparents, detailed family trees, or photos from special celebrations, HeyStory ensures that these moments are never forgotten and always accessible to future generations.

## The Problem

Valuable family stories, photos, and memories are lost over time and often remain unshared across generations. We live in a time where moments are shared instantly, but rarely saved meaningfully. Families today lack a unified, meaningful way to document and revisit their collective history.
