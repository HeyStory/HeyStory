Project Overview: Hey Story
‚ú® The Vision
In every family, there are treasured stories, unforgettable milestones, and photographs that deserve to live on. Yet, over time, these precious memories fade, get lost, or remain unshared. The history that shaped who we are often disappears with those who lived it.

Hey Story is here to change that.

We are building a modern digital platform ‚Äî a secure, AI-powered space where families can easily capture, preserve, and share their legacies. Whether it's a childhood tale from a grandparent, a detailed family tree, or a photo from a special celebration, Hey Story ensures that these moments are never forgotten and always accessible to future generations.

üß≠ The Problem
Valuable family stories, photos, and memories are lost over time
and often remain unshared across generations.

We live in a time where moments are shared instantly, but rarely saved meaningfully.
Families today lack a unified, meaningful way to document and revisit their collective history. Social media isn't built for legacy. Cloud folders get buried. Paper records vanish. And many stories go untold simply because there‚Äôs no intuitive place to tell them.

üí° The Solution
Hey Story is a digital home for family memories.
An intuitive platform to:

Record meaningful stories in audio, video, or text.

Visualize your family tree and explore your roots.

Celebrate special events that matter to your family.

Use AI to organize, connect, and enrich content for lasting value.

It's private, secure, and designed with warmth and intention ‚Äî so memories stay safe and storytelling becomes a shared tradition.

üöÄ MVP Scope
To bring this vision to life, our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will include the following four key pages:

1. Home Page
The central hub of the app. A welcoming space that introduces the user to their family archive, recent additions, featured stories, upcoming events, and suggested actions to keep their history alive.

2. Create Story Page
A rich, user-friendly interface where family members can write or record stories, upload photos, and tag relatives or events. AI assistance helps organize thoughts, transcribe audio, and suggest titles or summaries.

3. Events Page
A timeline of family milestones ‚Äî birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, reunions, and personal achievements. Each event can be enriched with stories, photos, and contributions from others in the family network.

4. Family Tree
An interactive, visual representation of the user's family. Add relatives, link stories to individuals, and navigate through generations with ease. AI suggestions can help fill gaps, group branches, and identify connections.

üõ†Ô∏è Future Potential
While the MVP is focused and foundational, Hey Story is built to grow. Upcoming features may include:

AI-driven story prompts and timeline generation

Secure sharing and collaboration among invited family members

Multilingual support for global families

Printed legacy books or digital time capsules

Voice-to-story transcription

Memory-based notifications ("On this day in your family...")

‚ù§Ô∏è Why It Matters
Hey Story isn't just another app. It's a movement to protect the emotional heritage of families. It‚Äôs about transforming fleeting moments into enduring legacy ‚Äî and making sure no voice, memory, or lesson is ever lost to time.

Join us in building something that generations will thank us for.
